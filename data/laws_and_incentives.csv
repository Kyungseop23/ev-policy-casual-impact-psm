4249,CA,Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Production Requirements,"The California Air Resources Board (CARB) certifies new passenger cars,
light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles as ZEVs if the
vehicles produce zero exhaust emissions of any criteria pollutant (or
precursor pollutant) under all possible operational modes and
conditions. Manufacturers with annual sales between 4,501 and 60,000
vehicles may comply with the ZEV requirements through multiple
alternative compliance options that include producing low emission
vehicles and obtaining ZEV credits. Manufacturers with annual sales of
4,500 vehicles or less are not subject to this regulation.

CARB's emissions control program for model year (MY) 2017 through 2025
combines the control of smog, soot, and greenhouse gases (GHGs) and
requirements for ZEVs into a single package of standards called Advanced
Clean Cars (ACC). In December 2012, CARB finalized new regulatory
requirements that allow vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) GHG requirements for MY 2017
through 2025 to serve as compliance with California's adopted GHG
emissions requirements for those same model years.

The accounting procedures for MY 2018 through 2025 are based on a credit
system as shown in the table below. The minimum ZEV requirement for each
manufacturer includes the percentage of passenger cars and light-duty
trucks produced by the manufacturer and delivered for sale in
California. The regulation also includes opportunities for compliance
with transitional ZEVs, which must demonstrate certain exhaust emissions
standards, evaporative emissions standards, on-board diagnostic
requirements, and extended warranties.

Cars II (ACCII), requiring an increasing percentage of ZEVs in new
vehicle sales beyond MY 2025. ZEV sales requirements under ACCII are

Vehicles Placed in Service on or After April 18, 2023

For vehicles delivered on or after April 18, 2023, limitations apply
that went into effect January 1, 2023, related to the vehicle's
manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP), the buyer's modified
adjusted gross income, and the vehicle's battery capacity. A North
American final assembly requirement applies for vehicles purchased on or
after August 17, 2022. Additional critical mineral and battery component
requirements also apply as of April 18, 2023, which alter how the tax
credit is calculated and may alter the amount of the tax credit
available. These latter requirements came into effect upon the
publication of the Treasury Department's guidance document regarding the
critical mineral and battery component requirements. Vehicles that meet
the critical mineral requirements are eligible for a \$3,750 tax credit,
and vehicles that meet the battery component requirements are eligible
for a \$3,750 tax credit. Vehicles meeting both the critical mineral and
the battery component requirements are eligible for a total tax credit
of \$7,500.

Vans, sport utility vehicles, and pickup trucks must not have an MSRP
above \$80,000, and all other vehicles may not have an MSRP above
\$55,000. The MSRP can be found on the vehicle's window sticker, which
is also known as the ""Monroney label""; the MSRP for this purpose
includes any trim, options, or accessories for the particular vehicle
and excludes the destination fee and dealer-provided options and
accessories.

Additionally, a taxpayer's eligibility for the tax credit may be limited
by thresholds for modified adjusted gross income (modified AGI); only
individuals having a modified AGI below the following thresholds for the
current tax year or the prior tax year are eligible for the tax credit:

-   \$300,000 for joint filers
-   \$225,000 for head-of-household filers
-   \$150,000 for all other filers

To be eligible for the Clean Vehicle Credit, the battery powering the
vehicle must have a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours (kWh). The
amount of the credit depends on whether the vehicle meets certain
critical minerals and battery component requirements.

**Critical Minerals:** To be eligible for the \$3,750 critical minerals
portion of the tax credit, the percentage of the value of the battery's
critical minerals that are extracted or processed in the United States
or a U.S. free-trade agreement partner or recycled in North America,
must meet or exceed the following thresholds:

Vehicles Sold on or After January 1 and Placed-in-Service Before April 18, 2023
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginning January 1, 2023, the Clean Vehicle Credit (CVC) provisions
removed the manufacturer sales caps for vehicles sold after January 1,
2023, expanded the scope of eligible vehicles to include both EVs and
FCEVs, and required that the battery powering the vehicle has a capacity
of at least seven kilowatt-hours (kWh). An available tax credit under
the CVC may be limited by the vehicle's manufacturer suggested retail
price (MSRP) and the buyer's modified adjusted gross income (as
addressed above). The North American final assembly requirement
continues to apply.

For vehicles placed in service before April 18, 2023, the available CVC
tax credit is a base amount of \$2,500 plus, for a vehicle that draws
propulsion energy from a battery with at least 7 kWh of capacity, \$417,
plus an additional \$417 for each kilowatt hour of battery capacity
beyond 5 kWh. The total tax credit available for a vehicle may not
exceed \$7,500.

Vehicles Purchased Between August 17 and December 31, 2022
----------------------------------------------------------

Qualifying EVs purchased and delivered between August 17, 2022, and
December 31, 2022, are eligible for the tax incentive as described below
for vehicles purchased before August 17, 2022, but are limited to
[vehicles with final assembly in North
America](https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxcenter.shtml). Manufacturer
sales caps on vehicles apply. Note that for some manufacturers, the
assembly location may vary because some models are produced in multiple
locations. The assembly location of a particular vehicle should be
confirmed by referring to its Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) using
the U.S. Department of Transportation's [VIN
decoder](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vin-decoder) or an information label
affixed to the vehicle.

Vehicles Purchased Before August 17, 2022
-----------------------------------------

Qualifying EVs purchased before August 17, 2022, are eligible for a tax
credit that is available for the purchase of a new qualified EV that
draws propulsion from a battery that has at least five kilowatt-hours
(kWh) of capacity, uses an external source of energy to charge the
battery, has a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 14,000 pounds, and
meets specified emission standards. The minimum credit amount is
\$2,500, and the credit may be up to \$7,500 based on each vehicle's
traction battery capacity. The credit will begin to be phased out for
each manufacturer in the second quarter following the calendar quarter
in which a minimum of 200,000 qualified PEVs have been sold by that
manufacturer for use in the United States. This tax credit is also
available for future EV owners with a written binding contract to
purchase a new qualifying electric vehicle before August 16, 2022, but
do not take possession of the vehicle until on or after August 16, 2022.

Credits for EVs and PHEVs in Category 1 are equal to the actual cost
incurred to purchase or lease the vehicle, multiplied by the battery
capacity, and divided by 100. That amount must be multiplied by a factor
to determine the credit amount, as follows: 1.0 for 2014-2018, 0.75 for
2019, 0.50 for 2020, and 0.25 for 2021.

Annual credit caps exist for each technology type and vehicle weight
class, and for cumulative annual credits. A person who claimed a tax
credit in previous years for the purchase or lease of Model Year 2004
and newer HEV may claim an additional credit for the conversion of the
same vehicle to a PHEV. The purchase of a used vehicle may qualify if
the vehicle was not previously registered in Colorado. Credits may not
be carried forward and a taxpayer will receive a refund for the excess
credit.

Credits for vehicles purchased, leased, or converted during the 2014 tax
year may be determined in one of two different ways. For more

(MOU) to support the deployment of MHD ZEVs through involvement in a
Multi-State ZEV Task Force (Task Force).

In July 2022, the Task Force published a [multi-state action
plan](https://www.nescaum.org/documents/multi-state-medium-and-heavy-duty-zev-action-plan.pdf)

strategies and recommendations to accomplish the goals of the MOU,
including limiting all new MHD vehicle sales in the signatory states to
ZEVs by 2050, accelerating the deployment of MHD ZEVs, and ensuring MHD
ZEV deployment also benefits disadvantaged communities.

357,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for Federal Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, 75% of new light-duty
vehicles acquired by covered federal fleets must be alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs). As amended in January 2008, Section 301 of EPAct 1992
expands the definition of AFVs to include hybrid electric vehicles, fuel
cell vehicles, and advanced lean burn vehicles. Fleets that use fuel
blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) may earn credits toward
their annual requirements. Federal fleets are also required to use
alternative fuels in dual-fuel vehicles unless the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) approves waivers for agency vehicles; grounds for a waiver
include lack of alternative fuel availability and unreasonable cost (per
EPAct 2005, section 701).

Additional requirements for federal fleets were included in the [Energy
Independence and Security Act of
2007](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/eisa), such as fleet management
plans and petroleum reduction from 2005 levels (Section 142), low
greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting vehicle acquisition requirements (Section
141), and renewable fuel infrastructure installation requirements
(Section 246). For more information, see the [Federal Fleet
Management](https://federalfleets.energy.gov/) website.

To track progress toward meeting AFV acquisition and fuel use
requirements, federal fleets must report on their percent alternative
fuel increase compared to the fiscal year 2005 baseline, alternative
fuel use as a percentage of total fuel consumption, AFV acquisitions as
a percentage of vehicle acquisitions, and fleet-wide miles per gasoline
gallon equivalent of petroleum fuels.

Executive Order 13834, issued in May 2018, requires the Secretary of
Energy (Secretary), in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the
Administrator of General Services, and the heads of other agencies as
appropriate, to review the existing federal vehicle fleet requirements.
In April 2019, the Secretary provided a report to the Chairman of the
Council on Environmental Quality and the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget detailing opportunities to optimize federal fleet
performance, reduce associated costs, and streamline reporting and
compliance requirements. Specifically, the report recommends that
federal agencies identify and implement strategies to:

-   Right-size the fleet
-   Reduce vehicle miles traveled
-   Implement more fuel efficient vehicles
-   Align the implementation of AFVs and associated fueling
    infrastructure

Executive Order 14008, issued in January 2021, requires the Chair of the
Council on Environmental Quality, the Administrator of General Services,
and the Director of the Office and Management and Budget, in

(Sub-Council) to help develop, implement, and improve programs, plans,
and policies that save money, reduce emissions, promote domestic fuel
use, and conserve natural resources. The Sub-Council will:

-   Develop standard procedures and formulas for modeling and monitoring
    potential alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and fuel reduction
    efforts that link acquisition and operations budgets;
-   Create an idle reduction policy for state agencies;
-   Create a process that allows fleet coordinators to replace vehicles
    with AFVs before standard retirement age if the replacement is
    cost-effective;
-   Identify and evaluate other fuel-saving practices and develop
    procedures for their implementation; and
-   Evaluate alternative financing options for state fleet vehicles
    including leasing, energy performance contracting, and other options
    that may reduce costs.

In addition, DPA and CDOT will establish policies and procedures to
promote the cost-effective use of non-petroleum fuel vehicles and other
fleet efficiency improvements. The policies must strive for the use of
non-petroleum based fuels at least 90% of the time when cost-effective.

all state-owned diesel vehicles and equipment to be fueled with a diesel
blend of 20% biodiesel (B20), subject to the availability of the fuel
and so long as the price differential is not greater than \$0.10 more
per gallon compared to conventional diesel. Biodiesel is defined as fuel
composed of mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from
plant or animal matter that meets ASTM specifications and is produced in
Colorado. DPA must increase the use of alternative fuels and establish
objectives to increase its use for each succeeding year. DPA must
purchase motor vehicles that operate on compressed natural gas (CNG),
electric vehicles, or vehicles that operate on other alternative fuels,
subject to the availability of vehicles and adequate fueling
infrastructure and assuming the incremental base or life cycle cost of
the vehicle is not more than 10% over the cost of a comparable dedicated
conventional vehicle. Some vehicles may be exempt from this requirement
if available alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) do not meet application
requirements. On or before November 1 of each year, DPA must submit a
report to the general assembly outlining vehicle purchases, including
alternative fuel and conventional vehicles; alternative fueling
infrastructure availability in the state; AFV purchase exemptions;
administrative policies in place to facilitate the purchase of AFVs;
suggested changes to facilitate the gradual conversion of the motor
vehicle fleet to AFVs; and a plan for the necessary infrastructure
development.

2004 and subsequent model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and
medium-duty passenger vehicles meeting specified exhaust standards. The
LEV II standards represent the maximum exhaust emissions for LEVs, Ultra
LEVs, and Super Ultra LEVs, including flexible fuel, bi-fuel, and
dual-fuel vehicles when operating on an alternative fuel. MY 2009 and
subsequent model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty
passenger vehicles must meet specified fleet average greenhouse gas
(GHG) exhaust emissions requirements. Each manufacturer must comply with
these fleet average GHG requirements, which are based on California Air
Resources Board (CARB) calculations. Bi-fuel, flexible fuel, dual-fuel,
and grid-connected hybrid electric vehicles may be eligible for an
alternative compliance method when operating on gasoline.

In December 2012, CARB finalized regulatory requirements, referred to as
LEV III, which allow vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's GHG requirements for MY 2017-2025 to
serve as compliance with California's adopted GHG emissions requirements
for those same model years.

In November 2022, CARB approved LEV IV standards, which updates
regulations for light- and medium-duty internal combustion engine
vehicles by reducing allowable exhaust emissions and emissions caused by
evaporation. LEV IV also changes the calculation procedure for new
vehicle fleet-average emissions and prohibits zero emissions vehicles
from being considered in fleet-average emissions calculations by MY
2029.

vehicles (AFVs). In January 2004, DOE published a final rule announcing
its decision not to implement an AFV acquisition mandate for private and
local government fleets. In response to a March 2006 ruling by a U.S.
District Court, DOE issued a subsequent final rulemaking on the new
Replacement Fuel Goal in March 2007, which extended the EPAct 1992 goal
to 2030. The goal is to achieve a domestic production capacity for
replacement fuels sufficient to replace 30% of the U.S. motor fuel
consumption. In March 2008, DOE issued its determination not to
implement a fleet compliance mandate for private and local government
fleets, concluding that such a mandate is not necessary to achieve the
Replacement Fuel Goal. For more information on the Private and Local
Government Fleet Rule compliance, visit the [EPAct Private and Local

347,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for State and Alternative Fuel Provider Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, as amended, certain state
government and alternative fuel provider fleets are required to acquire
alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) as a portion of their annual light-duty
vehicle acquisitions. Compliance is required by fleets that operate,
lease, or control 50 or more light-duty vehicles within the United
States. Of those 50 vehicles, at least 20 must be used primarily within
a single Metropolitan Statistical Area/Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area, and those same 20 vehicles must also be capable of
being centrally fueled for the fleet to be subject to the regulatory
requirements.

Under [Standard
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/standard-compliance), the AFVs that
covered fleets acquire help them achieve compliance, with each AFV
acquired earning the fleet one AFV-acquisition credit. Covered fleets
may earn additional credits for AFVs earned in excess of their
requirements, and these credits may be banked for future use toward
compliance or traded with other fleets. Additionally, fleets that use
fuel blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) in medium- and
heavy-duty vehicles may earn credits toward their annual AFV-acquisition
requirements. A fleet may also earn credits that may be used toward
compliance or banked once the fleet achieves compliance for investments
in alternative fuel infrastructure, mobile non-road equipment, and
emerging technologies associated with certain electric drive vehicle
technologies.

Fleets may also opt into [Alternative
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/alternative-compliance), which
allows fleets the option to choose a petroleum reduction path in lieu of
acquiring AFVs under Standard Compliance. Interested fleets must obtain
from DOE a waiver from Standard Compliance by submitting a plan that
demonstrates a path by which they will achieve a certain level of
petroleum reduction specific to their fleet composition.

must identity and solicit input from communities that are
disproportionally impacted by GHG pollution and environmental risk, such
as minority, low-income, tribal, and indigenous populations. The
Division of Administration of the Department of Public Health and
Environment (Division) must report to the general assembly on a
bi-annual basis regarding the progress towards the GHG reduction targets
and make recommendations on future legislative actions to address
climate change.

On January 14, 2021, the Division released the [GHG Pollution Reduction
Roadmap](https://energyoffice.colorado.gov/climate-energy/ghg-pollution-reduction-roadmap)
with recommendations to reduce GHG pollution in the transportation
sector by 25% by 2025, 40% by 2030, and nearly 100% by 2050 to meet
state-wide GHG emission targets. Recommendations include securing new
revenue to fund infrastructure and incentives for electric cars, trucks,

Vehicle Equity Study to identify frontline communities who are
disproportionately affected by transportation pollution or experience
barriers to equitably access electric transportation.
